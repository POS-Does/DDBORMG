Will generate different files using a jdbc mysql connection to retrieve specific information about tables, index, and foreign keys.

Currently can:

- Generate .sql files of schema, initial data, and test data
- Generate Android classes pertaining to each table in the database, as well as creating the cache methods and classes
- Generate Java (non Android) classes for use in java programs such as the print server
- Generate the PHP cache class of all tables that can be cached

After code generation code must be formatted, IntelliJ IDEs can format the entire source structure with a single command.
